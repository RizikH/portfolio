    I'm a growing software engineer with a passion for full-stack development, 
    3D web experiences, and emerging technology. I love learning and building things that have impact. 
    My style is minimalistic yet elegant —with a touch of personality— and I believe in the beauty of constant evolution. 
    I enjoy collaborating with others to create meaningful work and am currently seeking full-time opportunities in full-stack development.
